# My Life After 20 Years

Sometimes,I imagine what I am like after 20 years.
I hope that,I am a complete and substantial person after 20 years.
I hope that,I still can write code after 20 years.
I hope that,I still hold a camera to catch the locomotive after 20 years,For my dream of railway culture.
I hope that,I can marry her,to form a happy family after 20 years.

For myself 20 years later, I have many illusions.But what I most yearn for is,I can live with my loved ones after 20 years.

At the same time,20 years is a long period of time in life.As all known,18 to 38 years old, is the most creative and exciting time for a person.I will cherish this 20 years of time in my life.I want to learn more knowledge to enrich myself.I want to express love to her.I want my dear to see my growth.
This is what I think of myself,during next 20 years,and after this period.
